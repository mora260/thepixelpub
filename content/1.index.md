Welcome to the Pixel Pub
#description
- My name is Andr√©s Mora, the creator of The Pixel Pub, a blog and YouTube channel dedicated to the indie game community.
- Here I share some details of my own indie game development journey hoping that it serves as a guide and inspiration to other indie devs.
- Expect blog posts and videos every now and then with some tips and tricks as I found them myself along the way.
